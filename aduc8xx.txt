This program is distributed under the GNU GPL license.

Made to work with ADuC842, but should work with any other uC of the family (except the first versions with loader 1.0 installed onboard).
Developed under Linux; works with Windows, too. It has been reported to be working with FreeBSD (Peter Gaus reports that it works with ADuC832 and ADuC834).

Accept and intelligently use multiple options. For example, you can blank and program the LPC device with one single command line:
# aduc8xx.pl --echip --program dummy.hex

When using aduc8xx.pl the first time, you will be asked for using the --port option. After the first successful using of the --port option, aduc8xx.pl writes its configuration in a hidden file named .aduc8xx.cfg in your home dir.
Under Linux, usually the port to be used is /dev/tty0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 or something like this (be sure to have the rights to access the port!). Under windows should be some COM (COM2, or COM3 or something similar).


----------------------------------------------------------
Using perl module Device::SerialPort (http://sendpage.org/device-serialport/)
or Win32::SerialPort (http://members.aol.com/Bbirthisel/alpha.html)

To install the perl module, download it the run "perl Makefile.PL" and "perl install.pl".
Under Linux: "perl Makefile.PL" and "make && make install".
Under Windows I used Active Perl (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl) with the optional module Win32/API (you can install it with the Active Perl Package Manager).

NOTE:
Recently (2014) I installed Active Perl Community Edition 5.16.3.1604 on a Windows XP system and I did not found the Win32::SerialPort any more in the default packages repository; I had to add the external Bribes (http://www.bribes.org/perl/) packages repository and install it from it:
# ppm repo add Bribes http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm
# ppm install Win32-SerialPort

----------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE:
Some ADuC derivates change the bootloader baud rate if you change the system clock from the default values.
aduc8xx.pl uses a fixed baud rate of 9600 baud and can not use any other baud rate for initiating the communication: so you should use a system clock in order to have a 9600baud rate of the bootloader.

If you use different, you should care of using available standard baud rates and you should modify the aduc8xx.pl source code in order to use it.

----------------------------------------------------------
Quickmode Option:
The --quickmode option changes the baud rate from the bootloader default (usually 9600) to the given value. It can be used only in the derivates that can use Timer 3 for baud rate generation.

If you try to program known chip with default crystal (i.e., when connection to bootloader initiated at 9600), settings for quickmode are detected and used automatically.

The value is composed by two comma-separated strings:
- The first string is the hex value of the registers T3CON+T3FD used for the baud rate generation; the values must be calculated as shown in the microcontroller datasheet (see the "Commonly used baud rates" table, if there is one).
- The second string is the desired baud rate for the PC serial port
Examples (for ADuC842 running with 32KHz crystal):
842D,19200
832D,38400
8309,57600
8209,115200

Known 115200 configs with default 32KHz crystal:
aduc832= 8209,115200
aduc834= 812D,115200
aduc836= 812D,115200
aduc842= 8209,115200
aduc843= 8209,115200
aduc844= 812D,115200
aduc845= 812D,115200
aduc846= 812D,115200
aduc847= 812D,115200
aduc848= 812D,115200

The ADuC842 bootloader use an internal value of 1 for the PLL configuration CPU core divider bits (CD2=0, CD1=0, CD0=1). I got this info with a few tries at different settings. I don't know if the bootloader uses this config in all the other derivates...

----------------------------------------------------------
Detect option
The --detect option try to initiate a communication with the bootloader; default communication init. baud rate is try to reset on 115200, and try 9600 baud after, but you can specify different baud rates.
This can be used if your system uses a clock different from the standard clock for the derivate.
NOTE: you MUST use a system clock than can produce a standard baud rate speed; non-standard baud rate are not supported.

If you use quickmode, and not finished previous interaction session, you should detect first at old quick speed, and then try 9600 baud again: "--detect 115200,9600" f.e. to get reconnect without need to reset device
