This program is distributed under the GNU GPL license.

Using perl module Device::SerialPort (http://sendpage.org/device-serialport/)

Made to work with ADuC842, but should work with any other uC of the family, too (except the first versions with loader 1.0 installed onboard).
Developed under Linux (SuSE 9.2); should work with Windows, too (using Win32::SerialPort module), BUT IT IS NOT TESTED YET.
If you are using aduc8xx.pl under windows, please tell me (faumarz@8052.it).

Accept and intelligently use multiple options. For example, you can blank and program the LPC device with one single command line:
# aduc8xx.pl --echip --program dummy.hex

When using aduc8xx.pl the first time, you will be asked for using the --port option. After the first successful using of the --port option, aduc8xx.pl writes its configuration in a hidden file named .aduc8xx.cgf in your home dir.
Under Linux, usually the port to be used is /dev/tty0 or /dev/ttyUSB0 or something like this (be sure to have the rights to access the port!). Under windows should be some COM (COM2, or COM3 or something similar).

If your PERL installation has not the Device::SerialPort module install, you will have to download and install it from
http://sendpage.org/device-serialport/
----------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE:
Some ADuC derivates change the bootloader baud rate if you change the system clock from the default values.
aduc8xx.pl uses a fixed baud rate of 9600 baud and can not use any other baud rate for initiating the communication: so you should use a system clock in order to have a 9600baud rate of the bootloader.

If you use different, you should care of using available standard baud rates and you should modify the aduc8xx.pl source code in order to use it.
